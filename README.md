# Project-2: CarNostic
CarNostic is a project base on the idea of providing a quick reference guide for common automotive issues.  CarNostic provides information on automotive issues such as warning lights, things to check if the vehicle won't start, etc..  In addition, it also provides instructions for common vehicle maintenance such as changing a flat tire, changing oil, etc..   
CarNostic was in collaboration between Hue (pprchang), Bryan (Bauter) and Gordon (GordonConness).
